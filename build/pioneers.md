In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System and nuked the Moon.  You know, as one does.

[]{.gamename} is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-6 players. 
One player takes on the role of **Mission Control** (or, *the MC* for short)
and controls **the Pions** -- humanity's prodigal, digital children
who have returned from the depths of space with technology far beyond that 
of 24th Century Earth.

The each of other players creates a **Survivor** who is part of the **Rag-Tag 
Fugitive Resistance** striving to free the Solar System from the crushing 
**Occupation**.  

## Saving the World { #toc-intro}

As member of the Resistance, your Survivor is part of a small cell of 2 to 5
freedom fighters that undertake missions, called **Ops**, that invariably 
involve blowing up lots and lots of murderous robots -- on Earth, in space,
or on one of the **Twelve Colonies of Man** scattered across the conquered
Solar System.

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for is a free drink in 
one of the underground speak-easies frequented by the Resistance fighters; 
if you fail, the best you'll get is one of those drinks lifted in honor of 
your sacrifice.

## Three Attributes {#toc-attributes .colbefore}

> "In retrospect, putting a map showing how to get back to Earth on those 
> old-fashioned space probes probably wasn't the smartest idea."
> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}

Your Survivor has three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

### Resource Pools {.colbefore #toc-pools}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**. At the start of each Op, your resource pools are set
to their maximum value; while the exact value will go up or down
during the Op, you can't go over your maximum value.

**Health** tells you how much Harm your Survivor can take before being 
KIA; each hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. Your class gives
you Talents that you can activate using Impulse.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have.  At the
beginning of each Op, you adjust your inventory by expending points from
your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

### Rolling the Dice {.colbefore #toc-dice}

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 
your score in that attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on 
one die against the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---                                                       
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.


## Survivor Creation {#toc-chargen .colbefore .nospan}

Creating a Survivor is dirt simple. There are just five steps,
then you're done.  
You can fill in the fields on the Survivor
Record, which is a sheet et for recording your character's 
details.

1. [Pick a Class.](#step-class){.page}
2. [Choose Your Home Colony.](#step-colony){.page}
3. [Grab your Gear.](#step-gear){.page}
4. [Snag a ship.](#step-ship){.page}
5. Come up with a Name.

Instructions for playing the MC [come later in the rules](#the-mc).

In the 24th Century, humanity has long since colonized the
Solar System, building both surface bases on inhospitable planets and
moons, and orbiting colonies above them.

Choose one of the following origins for your Survivor, and note it
on your Survivor Record.

- **Callistoan** You're from Jupiter's moon Callisto.  *+1 Ship-Telemetry on Liquid-Hydrogen Tankers.*
- **Cererean** You're from Ceres, in the Asteroid Belt. *+1 Ship-Gyro on Mining Rigs.*

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Gear {.breakbefore #step-gear }

When you first create your Survivor, you're given a suit of armor and
two or three weapons, as shown on the page for your class. 

If you don't like the results you rolled, you can spend one Kit before 
your mission to change those to another option on your list.

After each Op you have the option to spend 1 Kit each to change your armor
or weapon for any others, including those that aren't on your starting
gear list.

### Armor {#toc-armor }

Armor is *ablative*. meaning that when it protects you, it becomes weaker.
A new suit of armor starts out with a full set of charges, and you can repair
it between Ops to reset those charges to their maximum values.

::::::::::::: {.infolist  } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Assault Armor** Ignore 1 Harm per attack (6 charges)
- **Energy Siphon** Ignore Burn, Pulse, or Shock Harm (3 charges)
- **Stealthsuit** Ignore Harm from *far* sources (3 charges)
- **Tactical Vest** Ignore Harm from *close* sources (3 charges)
- **Vacsuit** You don't get KIA if your ship is destroyed (1 charge)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: {.infolist .breakable} ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Weapons {#toc-weapons }

Each weapon lists the ranges at which it can be used -- *close*, *mid*,
and *far* -- as well as the damage and any Weapon Tags (see below).

- **Autolaser**         *mid* Harm 2, Autofire, Burn
- **Autorifle**         *mid* Harm 1, Autofire, Heavy
- **Bow**               *mid, far* Harm 1, Reload
- **Flamethrower**      *close* Harm 2, AOE, Burn
- **Frag Grenade**      *close* Harm 1, Exploding, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Grenade Mortar**    *mid* Harm 3, Exploding, Reload, Tactical
- **Laser Grenade**     *close* Harm 1, AOE, Burn, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Laser Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, Handgun, Burn
- **Laser Rifle**       *mid, far* Harm 2, Burn
- **Pulse Grenade**     *close* Harm 1, AOE, EMP, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Pulse Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, EMP, Handgun
- **Pulse Rifle**       *mid* Harm 2, EMP, Heavy
- **Rocket Launcher**   *mid* Harm 3, Exploding, Heavy, Reload
- **SMG**               *close, mid* Harm 1, Autofire
- **Shotgun**           *close* Harm 2
- **Slug Pistol**       *close* Harm 1, Handgun
- **Slug Rifle**        *mid, far* Harm 2, Heavy
- **Sniper Rifle**      *far* Harm 2, Scope, Tactical
- **Taser Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, Handgun, Shock           
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
::::::::::::: {.infolist .breakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Weapon Tags {#toc-weapon-tags .colbefore}

These tags apply to both personal weaponry and weapons on spacecraft
[](#step-ship){.page}.

- **AOE** Affects multiple targets.
- **Autofire** Can hit multiple targets.
- **Burn** Does burn damage.
- **EMP**  Does pulse damage.
- **Exploding** Does explosive damage against multiple targets.
- **Friendly Fire** Targets allies in the range band.
- **Handgun** +1 Harm when fired with Gyro.
- **Heavy** +1 Harm when fired with Thrust.
- **Piercing** Ignores Resist.
- **Reload** Sometimes requires reloading.
- **Scope** Does +1 Harm if you remain stationary when firing.
- **Self-Destructive** Damages wielder.
- **Single-Use** You can only use this weapon once.
- **Shock** Does shock damage.
- **Tactical** Does +1 Harm when fired with Telemetry.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: { .infolist .unbreakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Other Items {#toc-gear-other .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} isn't a subtle game. You get a mission, go in, kill robots,
and get out. There's not a lot of room for the niceties -- your Survivors
are Resistance freedom fighters constantly on the run. There's not a need
for specialized equipment.
We assume your Survivor has the basics to do their jobs:

- **Clothes and a Backpack**
- **A Toolkit** for basic repairs
- **Water/Rations** dried "astronaut food"
- **A Map** of the mission area

If you need anything else, you can spend 1 Kit before or during the
mission to say you brought it with you.

#### Med Patch {#toc-gear-med-patch}

Med patches are one-shot sources of Health that are in high demand but
limited quantities among the Resistance. 

When they take their turn, 
a Survivor can use one on themselves or on another Survivor -- this doesn't
use up their opportunity to attack during a turn, although they can only use
one Med Patch each turn.

A Med Patch heals 1 Health and then is used up.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Fights {#toc-fights .breakbefore}

> "I fuckin' hate these goddamn space probes. 
> 'Explore the universe and report back' -- fuck that, does us
> no damn good down here on planet Earth. Earth first, always."
> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}


[]{.gamename} is a game of violent resistance to the Occupation, so
of course violence is likely to ensue. We call each instance of that a
a **Fight**.

In a fight, the players and the MC alternate turns -- each of the players
gets to have their Survivor do something, and then the MC takes a turn for
the Pions.

### Range Bands {#toc-range}

Unlike some tabletop RPGs, []{.gamename} is not concerned with exact position
and distance; instead, participants in a fight are classified as being in *close*,
*mid*, or *far* range, relative to the other combatants. This affects the 
effectiveness of most weapons and can interact with class's Talents.

### Player Turns {#toc-turn-player}

On the the players' turn, they can act in whatever order they like, until
every player has had to chance to act.

When it's your turn, you can do any or all of these:

1. **Change your Range Band** by one -- *close* to *mid*, *mid* to *close* or *far*,
or *far* to *mid*. (You can't jump from *close* to *far* or vice versa.)

2. **Make an Attack** against one of the Pions.

3. **Use Your Talents** by paying a cost from the appropriate pool. You can use
   as many Talents as you wish during your turn, but you can only activate each
   Talent once during that turn.

4. **Use an Object** if you've picked up something interesting along the way or are
   carrying a [med patch](#toc-gear-med-patch){.page}.

### Attacking {#toc-attacking .breakbefore }

To attack, choose which weapon you're using and which attribute you're using for the
attack -- *Thrust* for a direct attack, *Gyro* for quick strikes or feints, and 
*Telemetry* for a steady, aimed attack -- and pick your targets.

Roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your score in the attribute, then compare the
hightest die to the total. 

On a **5 or 6,** you hit your target and do damage equal to the Harm rating of your weapon. 

If the high score is a **3 or 4,** you still do the same Harm, but there's also
a *Complication*, which means the MC gets to have the Pions do something -- usually
doing Harm to your Health.

If you didn't roll higher than a **1 or 2**, then you failed to Harm your target, and
the MC can make a move for the Pions.

#### Doing Harm {#toc-harm}

When you successfully hit a Pion with a weapon, you do Harm equal to the weapon's Harm
score, plus other modifiers such as the weapon's tags.

Most weapons do *untyped Harm*, meaning it's not some energy type. Weapons with specific
tags do *burn*, *exploding*, *pulse* or *shock* Harm. 

If a target has a **Resist** tag against a type of harm, they take 1 less point of
Harm from the attack. Conversely, if they have a **Vulnerability** to that type of
harm, they take an extra 1 point of Harm.

Each Pion is resistant and vulnerable to different types of attacks, so it pays to switch
up your tactics during a fight as you discover how it reacts to each.

### The MC's Turn {#toc-turn-mc .breakbefore }

During the MC's turn, they can do any or all of these:

1. **Change the Range Band** for some or all of the Pions, relative to the Survivors.

2. Make a **Big Change** in the fight.

3. Have the **Pions make moves.**

4. Have the **Pions counter-attack.**

At the end of the MC's turn, two things happen:

1. **The MC generates Drops** if any Pions were killed since the end of their last
   turn.

2. **Check on dying characters.**

#### Big Changes {#toc-big-changes}

A Big Change means that the battle is shifting in some way -- it might be that
the Pions retreat to a secured location. It could be that a new, larger model of Pion
arrives. The environment could be working against the Survivors -- barriers slamming
down, hatches opening to space, a rumbling geiser erupts.

The idea is not to undo the players' hard-earned victories but to change things
up so that their tactics evolve.

#### Pion Moves {#toc-pion-moves}

Each model of Pion has three "moves" listed that describe their usual tactics
in battle. These aren't just methods of attack but give a specific feel to each
type of Pion -- playing to these standard moves rewards the players for learning
what each does, while subverting the moves can be a Big Change itself.

#### Pion Counter-Attacks {#toc-counter-attack .breakbefore}

Usually, the MC doesn't need to specifically have the Pions attack; complications rolled
by the players are usually enough to keep the flow of damage in both directions.
However, a concentrated counter-attack could be the Big Change that the MC chooses during
their turn. 

When this happens, the MC describes the type of attack or attacks used by each enemy, and
the players can describe how their Survivor is avoiding the Harm. They roll the appropriate
number of dice and check the high number as always; on a 5 or 6, they escape taking any
Harm; 3 or 4 they take Harm equal to half the Pion's Harm rating; and 1 or 2 they take
the full amount of Harm.

#### Drops {#toc-drops}

At the end of the MC's turn, they one die 1d6 for each enemy that died since the end of
the MC's last turn, and check this table.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: drops :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Roll  Pool        Example
------ ----------- -----------------------------------
1-2    +1 Health   Defeating the Pion gave a quick opportunity to bandage wounds.
3-4    +1 Impulse  The rush of victory is invigorating.
5-6    +1 Kit      Scraps of Pions can be used for a variety of purposes.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The players can then decide among themselves who will claim each drop. No player can
exceed their maximum in a pool.`

#### Death and Dying

[]{.gamename} isn't, broadly speaking, a happy game where the Survivors triumph and
a parade is thrown in their honor. Instead, human civilization is on the brink of
destruction and the Survivors' actions can only delay an end that seems inevitable.
The spectre of death hangs over each Survivor and many are haunted by what they've
seen and done.

When a Survivor is reduced to 0 Health, they're **Taken Out** of this fight and don't
get to act during the Survivors' Turn step of the fight. This lasts as long as they
are at 0 Health.

At the **end of the MC's turn**, each player whose Survivor is at 0 Health rolls a
die and checks the following table.
If another Survivor gave first aid to the dying Survivor during their previous turn,
they can roll a die as well, and the Survivor uses the best value of any die rolled.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

By the first part of the 24th Century, mankind has left their home planet of
Earth and spread throughout the Solar System. 

The first surface colonies on
the Moon and Mars were soon joined by orbital colonies in long, rotating spheres
or wide, cirling toruses, housing up to several million people.
Even more remote settlements were built in asteroids or buried into the
surface of terrestrial planets.

Beginning with Mars and then Ceres, some colonies were granted independence, 
allowing them to function as the equivalent of national governments. 
The costly and asymmetrical Colonial War of the 2270s granted independence 
to all human colonies outside of the Earth's orbit.

### Location Tags {#toc-location-tags .breakbefore}

These are tags that apply to locations within the Solar System that can be used to
give MCs and players an idea as to what any particular planet or satellite is like,
as well as the level of Pion influence.

For more information on locations in the Solar System, including photographs or
artists' renderings, check out 
[NASA's web site](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/index.html){.page}!
Apart from being set 300 years in the future and occupied by humans and killer
robots, the Solar System of []{.gamename} is the same Solar System we inhabit today.

::::::::::: { .infolist .breakable              } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Atmosphere** The location has a breathable atmosphere.
- **Blockade** Currently blockaded by the Pions.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
### Earth Orbit {#toc-location-earth .breakbefore}

Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large
orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit used for farming.

Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological workers.
It's also the communications hub of the Solar System ... or at least, it *was*,
until key stations were struck by Pion nuclear weapons.

Located in the La Grange L5 point, O'Neill Station is the largest orbital colony 
in the Solar System. McKendree Station, O'Neill's sister station, was cataclysmically
destroyed in 2150 in the largest space disaster in human history -- with over
2 million humans dying instantly.

### Inner Planets {#toc-location-inner .breakbefore}

Mercury is a very hot planet on the side facing the sun, and a very cold planet on the
side facing away from the sun. Low-scale mining takes place there, plus solar batteries
store photonic energy for shipment throughout the Solar System.

Venus has floating cloud cities occupied by the wealthy above, and gas miners on the lower decks.
The atmosphere remains poisonous to human lungs, but extensive glass walls give the Venusian
colonies the appearance of domed cities.

Mars is the most populous and oldest colony in the Solar System. Its two moons are known
for their shipbuilding, although both have been seized by the Pions and are being refitted
to produce Pion craft instead.

Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt. Once the site of a major
mining operation, the asteroid is honeycombed with occupied tunnels and caverns. Ceres serves
as the capital of the Asteroid Belt and prior to the coming of the Pions was a major transit
port between the Inner Planets and the Outer Planets.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Jupiter {#toc-location-jupiter .breakbefore}

After Earth and Mars, Jupiter is the most populated planetary system in the
Solar System. No one dwells on the gas giant, of course, but 
all but one of Jupiter's largest moons are home to Earth colonies.

Europa is known for the indigenous life forms in its chilly seas -- a primitive
form of life akin to brine shrimp -- that was the source of the first
extraterrestial life found by humans. Europa is currently under a crushing
Pion blockade, but to date, they have attempted no landings there.

Cleomestra Station orbits Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System;
the Station is the second most distant orbital colony from Earth.
Prior to occupation by the Pions, Ganymede was a commerce port, centered on the
ice-mining trade.

Callisto's surface is dotted with numerous small manufacturing facilities, many of
them almost entirely automated, that are actively being bombarded by Pion 
*Sakigake* ships.

### Saturn {#toc-location-saturn .breakbefore}

Even in the 24th Century, the ringed giant remains widely acknowledged as among the
most breathtaking locations in the Solar System.
Of Saturn's many moons, only Titan and Enceledas have sizeable populations, with 
Rhea being a research station. 

The methane-based native life forms of Titan are found in its icy methane
seas and are massive, ponderous creatures somewhere between a coral colony and
enormous whales. Idaea Station, which orbits Titan, is the furthest orbital
colony from Earth and was built using materials mined on Jupiter's moon Ganymede
rather than on ores mined in the asteroid belt.

Enceledus's colony is the oldest among Saturn's moons, and one of the few sources
of liquid water in the outer planets.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Uranus {#toc-location-uranus .breakbefore}

Terrorists claiming to represent the five distant Uranian colonies incited
the bloody Colonial War, described at the time as "Mankind's Last War."

Combining a frontier toughness with deep religious convictions, colonists
on Uranus's moons speak of themselves as Uranians first, not individual
colonies as found in Jupiter's and Saturn's satellites.

Oberon is the nominal capital of the Uranian colonies and the center of their
growing spiritual movement.

chilly moon of Triton is home to just a small ice mining colony affiliated
with the Plutonian colony.

- **Triton** Minimal Population, Cold, Ice, Low-G, Surface
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: infolist ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Trans-Neptunian Space {#toc-location-trans }

Pluto is the second most distant human colony and is primary for astronomical 
research; in 2309, they detected anomalous radio signals from the vicinity
of Episilon Eridani that continue to defy human explanation. The sub-surface
astro-colony was the first human settlement to encounter the returning Pions.
Pluto fell to their troops and went radio-silent a full three days before
the attack on Luna, although few seemed to seem to care at the time.

Eris is on the farthest edge of the Solar System and is a mining penal colony. 
Its remoteness let it escape Pion notice; with the occupation of Earth,
the prison's wardens soon lost control of the inmates, who seized control of
the distant colony. Of the few convicts who have managed to leave the dwarf
planet, most have joined with the Resistance.

Six classes of pions have been positively identified, although there may be
more as yet unseen.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Cassini** Diplomat
- **Mariner** Troop transport
- **Rover** Infantry
- **Ulysses** Commander
- **Venera** Air Support
- **Viking** Marine
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Cassini {#toc-pion-cassini }

The only pions who have verbally spoken with humans. Roughly humanoid,
slender, eight feet tall, and with clear domes over their blinking cybernetic
brains. They're the spokesrobots for the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 5
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Finger Lasers** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn 
- **Moves** Sarcastically issue threats, call for help, strategic withdrawal
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Mariner {#toc-pion-mariner .colbefore}

The largest of the non-vessel Pions, they're less like individual robots 
and more like small shuttlecraft used as troop transports.
Their rectangular bodies are the size of a large 
truck and have fore- and aft-facing cannons. 

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 20 (Ship-2)
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Thunder Cannons** *mid, far* Harm 4, Exploding

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Rover  {#toc-pion-rover .breakbefore }

These pions are about the size of a large dog; their four limbs are made to 
fold inward, or extend to maneuver over obstacles. They're the rank-and-file
infantry of the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 4
- **Vulnerable** explosive

The Ulysses pions are the command-and-control leaders of pion ground forces,
including the rovers and the vikings. They're shaped like six-legged mechanical
spiders about the size of a small car, with sensors in all directions.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 7
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Micro-scramjet Swarms** *all* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Analyze tactics, coordinate troops, missile lock
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Venera {#toc-pion-venera .breakbefore }

Venera pions are the air support for ground operations, offering eye-in-the-sky
intelligence reports to those on the ground. They look the most like old NASA
probes of any pions, resembling armored viking orbiters.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 6
- **Vulnerable** burn
- **Focused Microwave Pulse** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn
- **Moves** Transmit tactical telemetry, evasive maneuvers, crash and burn
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Viking  {#toc-pion-viking}

The viking-class pions are the most feared by resistance fighters, as they're
the heavy troopers of the Ooccupation. Reinforced weapon mounts surround a cylindrical
central body mounted on 12 flexible legs of variegrated size.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 9
- **Vulnerable** *nothing known*
- **Overkill Onslaught** *close, mid* Harm 5
- **Moves** Take the beachhead, support mission objective, go down fighting

## Ships {.breakbefore #step-ship}

[]{.gamename} isn't just a game that takes place on the surface of planets --
there's just as much that happens in the dark void of space.

Instead of the players all serving as crew on one large ship, each Survivor has 
access to one ship, randomly determined at character creation.

This section presents general rules on spacecraft and ship-to-ship combat;
for examples of ships, read about the [rag-tag fugitive fleet](#toc-fleet){.page}
and the [Pion ships](#toc-pion-ships){.page} in later sections.

The [Resistance Ops](#toc-ops){.page} has details on missions that happen 
both primarily in space and in a mixture of planetary and space action.

### Ship Stats {.colbefore}

Each ship is defined by the following stats:

:::::::::::::::::::: {.breakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Thrust** Which works as the personal attribute, but for the ship.
- **Gyro** Also works as the personal attribute.
- **Telemetry** And also the same as the personal attribute.
- **Health** Ships are rated with Ship-Health scores; each Ship-Health
  point is equal to 10 personal Health points. Things that heal
  Ship-Health can't heal personal Health, and vice versa.
  Ship-Health is lost only to weapons that do Ship-Harm.
- **Resist and Vulnerable** Ships resistant to certain attacks take
  1 less Ship-Harm from those attacks, while those vulnerable to such
  attacks take 1 more Ship-Harm.
- **Mount Points** These are an abstraction of the ability to add
  weapons and other devices onto a ship. Most ships have between 1
  and 4 Mount Points. At the start or end of an op, a player can spend 
  1 Kit to swap 1 piece of mounted gear for another.
- **Tags** Like weapon tags and system tags, ship tags give a ship new
  abilities. At the start or end of an op, a player can spend 2 Kit
  to swap 1 Tag for another.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Ship Fights {#toc-ship-fights .colbefore}

Ship fights work exactly like normal fights, except that instead of using
your Survivor's Thrust, Gyro, or Telemetry, you use the ship's attribute.

If a ship is destroyed, anyone on board is KIA unless the ship has the EVA
tag, the ship has Escape Pods, or a person is wearing [a vacsuit](#toc-armor){.page}.

At the end of their turn, the MC still [rolls as normal for drops](#toc-drops){.page}
for any Pion killed, but uses the following table instead:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: drops :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Roll   Pool           Example
------- -------------- -----------------------------------------
 1-3    +1 Ship-Health With one less Pion to worry about, the pilot can get their ship running again.
 4-6    +1 Impulse     Acts of destruction only spur some people forward toward ... even more destruction.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Ship-Ranges {.breakbefore}

Ranges in spacecraft fights use the same *close*, *mid*, *far* bands as personal
fights, but refer specifically to *close-ship*, *mid-ship*, and *far-ship* ranges.
All personal range bands are within *close-ship* range.

### Ship-Talents and Regular Talents

Each class has one Ship-Talent that applies only to spacecraft fights; it can't be used
in regular fights. Likewise, no standard Talents can be used in a ship-to-ship fight.

### Ship-Mounted Equipment {#toc-ship-weapons .colbefore }

These weapons or other devices are attached to a ship's mount points.
The tags for ship equipment are equivalent to the
[parallel tags for personal weapons](#toc-weapon-tags){.page}.

:::::::::::::{ .infolist .breakable } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Asteroid Drill**         *close-ship* Harm Ship-2
- **Booster Rocket**         *mid-ship, far-ship* Harm Ship-5, Explosive, Single-Use

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Ship Tags {#toc-ship-tags .colbefore }

These tags give ships additional abilities. At the start or end of an op, a player can
spend 2 Kit to switch one tag for another.

:::::::::::::: {.infolist } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Atmospheric** Can touch down or launch in an atmsophere.

## Pion Spacecraft {#toc-pion-ships .breakbefore}

Pion ships are essentially huge, self-piloting robot vehicles; each is controlled by 
redundant central computers, and has no separate pilot.

The five known types of Pion ships are:

- **Genesis** Worldship
- **Kosmos** Carrier
- **Mariner** Troop transport and lander
- **Sakigake** Artillery Ship
- **Zond** Interdictor

:::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Genesis {#toc-pion-ship-genesis .colbefore}

Only one of these is ships is known to exist, and that's fortunate. Nearly the
size of O'Neill Station, *Genesis* is a mobile battlestation that was at first
mistaken for a small natural satellite, but this is no moon.

*Genesis* is only found in Earth orbit or nearby.

- **Health** Ship-1000
- **Vulnerable** *nothing*
- **Ship-to-Ship Defense Batteries** *close-ship* Harm Ship-2, Burn
- **Pulse Cannons** *mid-ship* Harm Ship-4, Pulse
- **Tracer Railguns** *far-ship* Harm Ship-6, Autofire
- **Moves** Rain death and destruction upon the Earth, direct the fleet, orbit ominously
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Kosmos {#toc-pion-ship-kosmos .colbefore}

A total of 8 *Kosmos* carriers have been identified by Resistance Intel Officers.
One is in Earth orbit, and another in Lunar orbit. Every human colony under a
blockade -- Ceres, Europa, and Titan -- has a *Kosmos* craft stationed nearby,
and three more prowl the reaches of the Solar System.

Their primary function is akin to an aircraft carrier. They have facilities
for creating and launching the *Zond* attack interceptor craft, and landing
facilities for those and other Pion ships, including hangars for *Mariners.*

- **Health** Ship-50
- **Vulnerable** burn
- **Electrostatic Defense Field Generators** *close-ship* Harm Ship-2, AOE, Shock
- **Moves** Launch interdictors, fire point defense guns, recall Zonds
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Mariner {#toc-pion-ship-mariner .colbefore}

*Mariners* are the smallest of the Pion ships, even smaller than the *Zonds.*
Unlike most spacecraft, they *can* be affected by personal-level weaponry;
see the section on planetary Pions 
[for their stats in a personal context](#toc-pion-mariner){.page}.

In addition to transporting troops, *Mariners* also move Cassini-class Pions
and valuable human prisoners within planetary systems. They're found throughout
the Solar System.

### Sakigake {#toc-pion-ship-sakigake .colbefore}

Smaller than the *Kosmos*-class carriers, *Sakigake* craft are primarily weapons
of mass destruction that can attack from the edge of a planet's orbit. They're
mostly used to shell occupied planets that get out of line and destroy
infrastructure on colonies that resist traditional occupation.
*Sakigakes* are found wherever the Pions are actively besieging a colony --
Mercury, Luna, and Callisto.

At least two dozen *Sakigake* are known to exist; they usually travel in pairs, 
with *Zond* escorts. Although they pack a devastating punch,
*Sakigakes* are, relatively speaking, glass cannons.

### Zond {#toc-pion-ship-zond .colbefore}

*Zond*-class craft are agile and deadly interceptor craft that hunt in packs
like wolves or sharks. They're most frequently encountered near *Kosmos*
carriers or *Genesis*, although they can be found as escorts for any other
Pion craft. 

Their inability to function in any kind of atmosphere is the
only factor limiting their deadliness. Resistance pilots using
[shuttles](#toc-fleet-shuttle){.page} or
[racing yachts](#toc-fleet-racing-yacht){.page} have learned to ditch
their *Zond* pursuers with a dive into an atmosphere -- even one that's
not breathable by humans.

- **Moves** Concentrate on the leader, break off attack, suicide run

## Mission Control {#toc-mc .breakbefore}

If you're playing as Mission Control instead of creating
and playing a Survivor, you've got an important role in
the game -- but it's *not* to kill the other players'
Survivor characters.

Think of yourself less like the players' opponents and more
like a director or producer -- you give the players challenges 
that their Survivors can overcome, but you're still rooting
for them to win in the end.

In your role, you can control the pacing and difficulty of
the game more directly than the other players can. As a 
consequence, you shouldn't grow that attached to your own
Pions -- they only exist to put up a token amount of 
threat and then get mowed down by the Survivors.

### Rotating MCs

[]{.gamename} is a very *episodic* game, meaning that there aren't 
really storylines and plots that run from one Op to the next. 

That makes it to switch roles between Ops; for many groups, it
makes sense for a player to take on the MC role for one mission,
and then pass it on to another player at the end of an Op. 

This is how we recommend you play the game -- it gives everyone
a chance to experience the game from two different sides, and
all the players get to make up Survivors! Character creation can
be a fun mini-game.

### The Question of *Why?* {#toc-mc-why .colbefore}

You might notice that nowhwere in []{.gamename} do we
actually explain *why* the Pions are doing this. That's
deliberate, not an oversight!

In the TV shows and movies 
[that inspired this game](#toc-credits){.page}, such as
2004's *Battlestar Galactica*, attempts to explain the
backstories of the villains usually made the shows worse,
not better.

If it's going to make a difference in the way you play, then
of course you can make something up -- we're not stopping you!
But ultimately []{.gamename} just isn't a game about understanding
the motives of your enemies but about breaking evil robots, so
that's what the game does.

We also don't offer an explanation of why the Pions haven't wiped
out humanity and are instead trying to conquerer and control
Earth and her colonies. Also deliberate, and for the same
reason!

If the players bring this up during the game,
just smile knowingly and say something vague, like, "Hmm, that
*is* mysterious, isn't it?" If you're one of those players
reading this and the issue arises later, either play along with
the MC or make up some ridiculous cockamamie explanation. Hey,
maybe it's true in *your* game, right?

### Roleplaying the Pions {#toc-mc-rp .colbefore}

Unlike many roleplaying games, interactions between the player
characters and non-player characters don't play a huge role 
in []{.gamename} -- the preceeding section explains why!

The [Cassini model](#toc-pion-cassini){.page} are the only Pions
who talk, so when one of those shows up -- and they're found in
most Pion bases -- feel free to play them to the hilt. They're meant
to be the exact opposite of the alien, non-communicative types
that make up the vast majority of the Pions. Cassinis are snide,
taunting, and duplicitous.

You can also roleplay the other Pions without having them speak
directly. Describe how their sensors track the Survivors with
stony indifference. Give them unfamiliar beeps and electronic
squawks as they die; just make sure they're implacably 
inscrutable.


## Resistance Ops {#toc-ops .breakbefore}

The basic cycle of a []{.gamename} looks like this:

1. The players create Survivors.
2. Survivors are assigned an Op with a specific mission.
3. Survivors prepare for the Op and get in position.
4. One or more fights ensue on the way to completing that mission.
5. Survivors leave, bury their dead, and recover.
6. Back to 2, until the players are satisfied with the game.

Survivor creation is 
[covered in a previous section](#toc-chargen){.page}; this section
will tell you how to send those Survivors on those dangerous 
missions where they might get killed.

### Op Types {#toc-ops-types}

Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of Ops: **Planetary Ops**
that take place on the surface of a planet or moon; **Space Ops**
that happen in spacecraft; and **Combined Ops**.

Each has their own unique qualities, and in general it's more
fun to have variety in Op types.

Most Survivors' Talents are directly tied to personal-scale
fights, and those should be the emphasis of a []{.gamename} --
but not exclusively.

The bottom of this page has a chart you can use before an Op
to determine what type of mission it will it. Have one player
roll a die and then crossreference the last type of Op you
completed with the die roll, then check the following sections
for specific Op scenarios!

::::::::::::::::::::: opmasterchart :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll  No Prior Op  Last Op: Planetary  Space      Combined

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Planetary Ops {#toc-ops-planetary .colbefore}

On these missions, Survivors are tasked with carrying out an Op on the
surface of a planet or moon. Their gear will be adapted to function in
such an environment, if necessary -- for example, missions to Mars will
include O<sub>2 tanks and filters.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for a Planetary Op.

::::::::::::::::::: opstable ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Sabotage Industrial Center** 1 on Earth, 2 on Venus, 3-4 on Mars, 5 on Mimas, 6 in the asteroid belt
     2        **Rescue Crash Survivors** 1-2 on Titan, 3-4 on Oberon, 5-6 on Io
     3        **Liberate a Settlement** 1-2 on Venus, 3-4 on Mars, 5-6 on Enceledas
     4        **Destroy a Pion Base** 1 on Earth, 2-3 on Venus, 5-6 on Mars, 6 on Dione
     5        **Steal Intelligence** 1 from Earth, 2-3 from O'Neill Station, 4 from Venus, 5 from Mars, 6 from Ganymede's Cleomestra Station
     6        **Assassinate a [Cassini](#toc-pion-cassini){.page}** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 on O'Neill Station, 5 on Ganymede, 6 on Pluto
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Space     Ops {#toc-ops-space .colbefore}

For these missions, the Survivors have to perform a mission primarily in
space. At no cost, a Survivor can swap out their armor for a 
[vacsuit](#toc-armor){.page} without paying a cost in Kit.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for a Space Op.

::::::::::::::::::: opstable ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Salvage** 1-2 the asteroid belt, 3-4 near Triton, 5-6 near Pluto
     2        **Escort Mission** 1-2 Callisto to Europa, 3-4 Enceledas to Ariel, 5 Oberon to Triton, 6 Pluto to Earth
     3        **Destroy a [Sakigake](#toc-pion-ship-sakigake){.page}** 1-2 near Callisto, 3-4 near Mercury, 5-6 near Oberon
     4        **SOS Received** 1-2 in the asteroid belt, 3-4 near Jupiter, 5-6 near Saturn
     5        **Resupply Eris** 1-2 food, 3-4 fuel, 5-6 water
     6        **Blockade-Running** 1-2 to Ceres, 3-4 to Europa, 5-6 to Titan
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Combined  Ops {#toc-ops-combined .colbefore}

Specialized gear for use on a surface will be issued to the Survivors,
as per planetary ops. At no cost in Kit, a player can choose to have a 
vacsuit on their ship for this mission, and can switch between that and
their normal armor during a lull in the action.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for an Op that
has both Planetary and Space objectives.

::::::::::::::::::: opstable ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Free Important Prisoners** 1-2 on Venus, 3-4 on O'Neill Station, 5-6 on Ganymede's Cleomestra Station
     2        **Rescue Trapped Colonists** 1 on Luna, 2 on Mars, 3-4 on Europa, 5 on Callisto, 6 on Mirans, 
     3        **Liberate a Ship** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 Earth orbit, 5-6 on Mars
     4        **Evac a Resistance Base** 1-2 on Mercury, 3-4 in the asteroid belt, 5-6 on Callisto
     5        **Broadcast a Message** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 on Luna, 5-6 on Pluto
     6        **Infiltrate [Genesis](#toc-pion-ship-genesis){.page}** 1-2 rescue a prisoner, 3-4 steal plans, 5-6 sabotage a comms center
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Mission Prep {#toc-ops-prep .colbefore}

Survivors' Health, Impulse, and Kit pools reset before an Op. Each player can
make a prep roll before an Op to prepare for the upcoming mission using an
attribute of their choice. The appropriate pool -- and its maximum value --
increases by 1 for the entirety of this Op.

 Die Roll   Attribute: Thrust    Gyro        Telemetry
----------  -------------------  ----------- -----------
   1        +1 Kit               +1 Health   +1 Impulse
  2-3       +1 Health            +1 Impulse  +1 Kit
  4-6       +1 Impulse           +1 Gear     +1 Health

Before each mission, players roll to see which weapons, armor, other gear,
and ships they have access to during this Op.
Any Survivor who has customized their weapon or ship can keep that from their
last Op and doesn't have to roll.

Right before an Op, a Survivor can spend Kit (and only Kit) to change out their
gear for another choice on the appropriate table. Survivors without a Med Patch
can also spend 1 Kit to grab a Med Patch -- but no Survivor can have more than
one at the start of an Op; they're too rare among the Resistance and are heavily
rationed.

### Travel Time {#toc-ops-travel}

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

:::::::::::::::::::: traveltimes :::::::::::
Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
as does travel between Earth and Luna.

For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
from Ceres.

For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
time, plus 1d6 weeks.

Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.

### When an Op is Over

An Op concludes when the Survivors have finished an Op, or when at
least one of them has died and the players decide to scrub the mission
and return home.

### Post-Op Recuperation {#toc-ops-post .colbefore}

After an Op, the Survivors retreat to a hidden base to await further
orders from the Resistance.

Any player whose Survivor died during the previous Op can create a
new Survivor during Post-Op Recuperation. Likewise, any player 
who wishes to try a different character can make a new one during 
the Post-Op.

Pools don't automatically refresh at the end of an Op. Survivors who
have points remaining in their Kit can spend 1 point on *one* of the
following options:

1. **Customize Weapons** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a weapon to a
   different Tag.

2. **Customize Ship Weaponry** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 ship-mounted weapon for
   a different ship weapon.

3. **Customize Ship Tags** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a ship for 
   a different ship Tag.

This game is primarily an homage 1970s-era space science and science fiction.

*Battlestar Galactica* in its original, 1978 form is a key inspiration, as
well as the later 2004-2009 remake.
Other influences include the obvious *Star Trek: The Motion Picture*, but also
*2001: A Space Odyssey*, *Space: 1999*, and *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century*.

Around 1975-1977, as a young nerd girl growing in California, I was fascinated
by astronomy and the *science-based* vision of a future in space portrayed in NASA's 
concept art -- some of which appears in []{.gamename}! -- that is, until a
certain *space opera* movie came out in the summer of 1977.
