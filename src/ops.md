## Op Types

There are three basic Op types:

- Planetary Ops
- Orbital Ops
- Combined Ops

## Preparing for the Mission

## Travel Time

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

- Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
  as does travel between Earth and Luna.

- For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
  1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
  from Ceres.

- For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
  1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)

- For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
  time, plus 1d6 weeks.

- Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.
