Your **Class** determines your attributes and pools, your talents,
and your starting equipment. Pick a class from this list:

- [**Apollo** ](#class-apollo ) You're big, strong, and tough in a fight.
- [**Gemini** ](#class-gemini ) You're smart, clever, and good with technology.
- [**Mercury**](#class-mercury) You're fast, agile, and hard to pin down.
- [**Soyuz**  ](#class-soyuz  ) You're a jack-of-all-trades and born leader.

The table below lists the attributes and pools for each class.

## Talents

Your class gives you **Class Talents**, a **React Talent**,
and a **Ship Talent**. Your Colonial Origin also gives you
a **Colony Talent**.

You can use one Class Talent, once, on your turn. 
Your React Talent can be used once each time you take Harm. 
Your Ship Talent can be used once on your turn.
Your Colony Talent is used whenever you are issued a new ship.
