# Ships {.breakbefore #step-ship}

[]{.gamename} isn't just a game that takes place on the surface of planets --
there's just as much that happens in the dark void of space.

Instead of the players all serving as crew on one large ship, each Survivor has 
access to one ship, randomly determined at character creation.

This section presents general rules on spacecraft and ship-to-ship combat;
for examples of ships, read about the [rag-tag fugitive fleet](#toc-fleet){.page}
and the [Pion ships](#toc-pion-ships){.page} in later sections.

The [Resistance Ops](#toc-ops){.page} has details on missions that happen 
both primarily in space and in a mixture of planetary and space action.

## Ship Stats {.colbefore}

Each ship is defined by the following stats:

:::::::::::::::::::: {.breakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Thrust** Which works as the personal attribute, but for the ship.
- **Gyro** Also works as the personal attribute.
- **Telemetry** And also the same as the personal attribute.
- **Health** Ships are rated with Ship-Health scores; each Ship-Health
  point is equal to 10 personal Health points. Things that heal
  Ship-Health can't heal personal Health, and vice versa.
  Ship-Health is lost only to weapons that do Ship-Harm.
- **Resist and Vulnerable** Ships resistant to certain attacks take
  1 less Ship-Harm from those attacks, while those vulnerable to such
  attacks take 1 more Ship-Harm.
- **Mount Points** These are an abstraction of the ability to add
  weapons and other devices onto a ship. Most ships have between 1
  and 4 Mount Points. At the start or end of an op, a player can spend 
  1 Kit to swap 1 piece of mounted gear for another.
- **Tags** Like weapon tags and system tags, ship tags give a ship new
  abilities. At the start or end of an op, a player can spend 2 Kit
  to swap 1 Tag for another.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Ship Fights {#toc-ship-fights .colbefore}

Ship fights work exactly like normal fights, except that instead of using
your Survivor's Thrust, Gyro, or Telemetry, you use the ship's attribute.

If a ship is destroyed, anyone on board is KIA unless the ship has the EVA
tag, the ship has Escape Pods, or a person is wearing [a vacsuit](#toc-armor){.page}.

At the end of their turn, the MC still [rolls as normal for drops](#toc-drops){.page}
for any Pion killed, but uses the following table instead:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: drops :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Roll   Pool           Example
------- -------------- -----------------------------------------
 1-3    +1 Ship-Health With one less Pion to worry about, the pilot can get their ship running again.
 4-6    +1 Impulse     Acts of destruction only spur some people forward toward ... even more destruction.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Ship-Ranges {.breakbefore}

Ranges in spacecraft fights use the same *close*, *mid*, *far* bands as personal
fights, but refer specifically to *close-ship*, *mid-ship*, and *far-ship* ranges.
All personal range bands are within *close-ship* range.

## Ship-Talents and Regular Talents

Each class has one Ship-Talent that applies only to spacecraft fights; it can't be used
in regular fights. Likewise, no standard Talents can be used in a ship-to-ship fight.

## Ship-Mounted Equipment {#toc-ship-weapons .colbefore }

These weapons or other devices are attached to a ship's mount points.
The tags for ship equipment are equivalent to the
[parallel tags for personal weapons](#toc-weapon-tags){.page}.
