:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

By the first part of the 24th Century, mankind has left their home planet of
Earth and spread throughout the Solar System. 

The first surface colonies on
the Moon and Mars were soon joined by orbital colonies in long, rotating spheres
or wide, cirling toruses, housing up to several million people.
Even more remote settlements were built in asteroids or buried into the
surface of terrestrial planets.

Beginning with Mars and then Ceres, some colonies were granted independence, 
allowing them to function as the equivalent of national governments. 
The costly and asymmetrical Colonial War of the 2270s granted independence 
to all human colonies outside of the Earth's orbit.

## Location Tags {#toc-location-tags .breakbefore}

These are tags that apply to locations within the Solar System that can be used to
give MCs and players an idea as to what any particular planet or satellite is like,
as well as the level of Pion influence.

For more information on locations in the Solar System, including photographs or
artists' renderings, check out 
[NASA's web site](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/index.html){.page}!
Apart from being set 300 years in the future and occupied by humans and killer
robots, the Solar System of []{.gamename} is the same Solar System we inhabit today.

## Earth Orbit {#toc-location-earth .breakbefore}

Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large
orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit used for farming.

Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological workers.
It's also the communications hub of the Solar System ... or at least, it *was*,
until key stations were struck by Pion nuclear weapons.

Located in the La Grange L5 point, O'Neill Station is the largest orbital colony 
in the Solar System. McKendree Station, O'Neill's sister station, was cataclysmically
destroyed in 2150 in the largest space disaster in human history -- with over
2 million humans dying instantly.

## Inner Planets {#toc-location-inner .breakbefore}

Mercury is a very hot planet on the side facing the sun, and a very cold planet on the
side facing away from the sun. Low-scale mining takes place there, plus solar batteries
store photonic energy for shipment throughout the Solar System.

Venus has floating cloud cities occupied by the wealthy above, and gas miners on the lower decks.
The atmosphere remains poisonous to human lungs, but extensive glass walls give the Venusian
colonies the appearance of domed cities.

Mars is the most populous and oldest colony in the Solar System. Its two moons are known
for their shipbuilding, although both have been seized by the Pions and are being refitted
to produce Pion craft instead.

Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt. Once the site of a major
mining operation, the asteroid is honeycombed with occupied tunnels and caverns. Ceres serves
as the capital of the Asteroid Belt and prior to the coming of the Pions was a major transit
port between the Inner Planets and the Outer Planets.

## Jupiter {#toc-location-jupiter .breakbefore}

After Earth and Mars, Jupiter is the most populated planetary system in the
Solar System. No one dwells on the gas giant, of course, but 
all but one of Jupiter's largest moons are home to Earth colonies.

Europa is known for the indigenous life forms in its chilly seas -- a primitive
form of life akin to brine shrimp -- that was the source of the first
extraterrestial life found by humans. Europa is currently under a crushing
Pion blockade, but to date, they have attempted no landings there.

Cleomestra Station orbits Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System;
the Station is the second most distant orbital colony from Earth.
Prior to occupation by the Pions, Ganymede was a commerce port, centered on the
ice-mining trade.

Callisto's surface is dotted with numerous small manufacturing facilities, many of
them almost entirely automated, that are actively being bombarded by Pion 
*Sakigake* ships.

## Saturn {#toc-location-saturn .breakbefore}

Even in the 24th Century, the ringed giant remains widely acknowledged as among the
most breathtaking locations in the Solar System.
Of Saturn's many moons, only Titan and Enceledas have sizeable populations, with 
Rhea being a research station. 

The methane-based native life forms of Titan are found in its icy methane
seas and are massive, ponderous creatures somewhere between a coral colony and
enormous whales. Idaea Station, which orbits Titan, is the furthest orbital
colony from Earth and was built using materials mined on Jupiter's moon Ganymede
rather than on ores mined in the asteroid belt.

Enceledus's colony is the oldest among Saturn's moons, and one of the few sources
of liquid water in the outer planets.

## Uranus {#toc-location-uranus .breakbefore}

Terrorists claiming to represent the five distant Uranian colonies incited
the bloody Colonial War, described at the time as "Mankind's Last War."

Combining a frontier toughness with deep religious convictions, colonists
on Uranus's moons speak of themselves as Uranians first, not individual
colonies as found in Jupiter's and Saturn's satellites.

Oberon is the nominal capital of the Uranian colonies and the center of their
growing spiritual movement.

## Neptune {#toc-location-neptune .breakbefore}

Once thought to be a prime location for extraterrestrial life, Neptune's
chilly moon of Triton is home to just a small ice mining colony affiliated
with the Plutonian colony.

## Trans-Neptunian Space {#toc-location-trans }

Pluto is the second most distant human colony and is primary for astronomical 
research; in 2309, they detected anomalous radio signals from the vicinity
of Episilon Eridani that continue to defy human explanation. The sub-surface
astro-colony was the first human settlement to encounter the returning Pions.
Pluto fell to their troops and went radio-silent a full three days before
the attack on Luna, although few seemed to seem to care at the time.

Eris is on the farthest edge of the Solar System and is a mining penal colony. 
Its remoteness let it escape Pion notice; with the occupation of Earth,
the prison's wardens soon lost control of the inmates, who seized control of
the distant colony. Of the few convicts who have managed to leave the dwarf
planet, most have joined with the Resistance.
