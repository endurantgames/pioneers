### Earth Orbit

Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large
orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit.

Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological workers.
It's also the communications hub of the Solar System ... or at least, it *was*.

Located in the La Grange 5 point, O'Neill Station is the largest orbital colony 
in the Solar System.

- **Earth** Maximum Population, Atmosphere, Blocade, Farming, Ice, High-G, Life, Manufacturing, Occupation, Orbit, Spaceport, Surface, Underground, Volcanos, Water
- **Luna** High Population, Colony, Low-G, Mining, Siege, Spaceport, Surface, Underground
- **O'Neill Station** Medium Population, Atmosphere, Farming, High-G, Occupation, Spaceport

### Inner Planets
Mercury is a very hot planet on the side facing the sun, and a very cold planet on the
side facing away from the sun.

Venus has floating cloud cities occupied by the wealthy above, and gas miners on the lower decks.

Mars is the most populous colony in the Solar System. Its two moons are known
for their shipbuilding.

Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt.

- **Mercury** Low Population, Bright, Cold, Colony, Hot, Mining, Orbit, Siege, Surface, Underground
- **Venus**  Medium Population, Colony, High-G, Hot, Life, Mining, Occupation, Orbit, Spaceport, Surface
- **Mars** High Population, Cold, Colony, Ice, Manufacturing, Mining, Occupation, Orbit, Spaceport, Surface, Underground
- **Ceres** Low Population, Blocade, Cold, Colony, Ice, Low-G, Mining, Spaceport, Underground

### Jupiter

All but one of Jupiter's largest moons are home to Earth colonies.

Europa is known for the indigenous life forms in its chilly seas -- a primitive
form of brine shrimp.

### Trans-Neptunian Space

Pluto is the second most distant colony and is primary for astronomical research.

Eris is on the far edge of the Solar System and is a mining penal colony. Its
remoteness let it escape Pion notice.
